# Movile Next - LiveData ViewModel
- **Chronometer activity**: Simple demonstration of ViewModel, it's state is saved then restored upon configuration change.
- **LiveData activity**: Similiar to the chronometer activity but this one uses LiveData to update the screen.
- **Seekbar activity**: It uses the ViewModel to keep state saved upon configuration changes and a LiveData to update both seekbar.
